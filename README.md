- PRs are detected via the incoming branch name (`snyk-fix-*` or `snyk-update-*`) and PR title `[Snyk] *`
- Snyk PRs will be automatically labelled with `snyk` label
- All Snyk PRs with the `snyk` label are merged together into a single SuperSnyk ðŸ¦¸ PR targeting `main` branch
- SuperSnyk ðŸ¦¸ PR body will be automatically updated with each child Synk PR using [autolink reference](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls) meaning merging the SuperSnyk ðŸ¦¸ PR will close all the snyky children ðŸ˜›
